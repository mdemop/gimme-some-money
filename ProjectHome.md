Gimme Some Money

This is a straight-up open source clone of Gimme Some Candy (www.gimmesomecandy.com). It's an awesome "tip jar with benefits" idea but they're not taking new artists and I wanted one of my own and thought other artists would benefit. Check it out over on the sidebar.

Requirements
