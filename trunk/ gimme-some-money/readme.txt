ABOUT

This is a straight-up open source clone of Gimme Some Candy 
(www.gimmesomecandy.com). It's an awesome "tip jar with 
benefits" idea but they're not taking new artists and I 
wanted one of my own and thought other artists would benefit.

	2. A Paypal account (http://www.paypal.com)

	
INSTALLATION

	1. Create the MySQL table (use structure.mysql)
